Slack
=====

Large portion of the coding for this is done, structure is there although largely hackishly put together. Regardless of the hackishness, very well put together and mostly stable (excluding WebSocket interactions with SlackAPI at time of writing this.) This is intended as a basis for a larger (better) Windows client.

This is intended to be a Windows Desktop (Linux/Mono supported)

Designed for performance and efficiency and trying my best to maintain Slack's image and high standards. Here's a nice image of what we've got so far:

Although not perfect, we're certainly trying.
